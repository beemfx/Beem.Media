Explor: A New World v0.04b
Copywrite (C) 2000 B.M. Software

This foler includes:
	ExplorB.bat - The Executable for Explor.
	game.dat - The data for the game.
	Maps.dat - The maps used in the game.
	Explor.zip - A zip file containing earlier developments of the game.
	runprog.pro - A file that runs the program.
	Readme.txt - This file.
	ExplorB.exe - The installation file.

Instructions:
	At the main menu you can press the button of the number corresponding to your choice.  To play press 1.  You will then be brought to the 3D screen.  Use the arrow keys to move around.  For more detailed instructions see the online instructions.  You may also press M to activate the automap (Note in online instructions).

Note:
	This program took up to much complicated memory stuff so it was not compiled.  I use a .bat file to make it look as though it was anyhow.

I'm currently working on some new artwork that's not so boring.  I've also decide to make the game hallway based because I'm no artist and I could not develop artwork that looked good.
