The obsolete folder contains developmental portions of ExplorED that are no longer used or are obsolete.  They are not used in the final release and there really isn't any reason (other than novelty) to keep them.  I don't know what most of them are anymore but I will try to give some kind of explanation here.

dosexplored: A dos version of explorED.  With the release of the windows version this project was stopped completely.

borland: Early development stage of ExplorED for windows.  This one is compatible with borland based compilers (under a win32 api).  It is now scrapped as the msvc version has all the same functionallity.

mapconv: a lot of routines used to update obsolete map formats.  None of them have any normal uses.

obsfunc: some badly written source code for very early versions of the development.

openmap: these funcitons were implemented into the dos version (which is now obsolete) and don't do much as standalone.  These might still have some use depending on how a developer feels about them.
