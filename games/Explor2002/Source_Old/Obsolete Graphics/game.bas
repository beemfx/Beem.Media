'Here it is the BETA release of EXPLOR it's not much but a good
'start.  You probably won't want to play it for much more than a
'couple of minutes, probably less actually, but it's worth your
'time.

'The game is completely based off Might and Magic (though there are other
'games like it).  I had Might and Magic for nintendo but it just wouldn't
'save right so I decided to make my own game.  It's rendured 3D just like
'the first two might and magic games.  It's pretty cool and I'm proud of
'myself.  I actually only spent three days on it.  The first two I spent
'an average of 12 hours a day on it.  (Why? Well I was bored.)  Anyway here
'it is.

'Log

'I originally had plans for this program but now it is deemed as junk
'It has a story and credits but no game I doubt that it ever will have
'a game because Joe's Copter II is a lot better than any exploring game
'maybe when I get the internet I will be able to allow other people to
'use this piece of junk I don't want to throw it away because I spent
'so much time on it.

'That's old news I'm going to reincorporate EXPLOR and start the project
'it may end up junk anyways.

'Damn!!! It works perfectly.
'Well since the ASCII graphics interface didn't work right I changed
'To regular VGA graphics.  I also incorporated the loadmap from venture.bas
'I'm sure the loser author won't care. Too much! Anyways he'll never know.
'The load map works extremely well.  I figure if I want a different map
'loaded I can just use different subs for different levels.  Anyway I have
'to change the movement arrow to VGA graphics rather than ASCII then I will
'have to redefine the movement so it stops when approaching a wall.
'I don't want to do that today though. It will actually take a while.
'Turnleft and Turnright will not to be changed but calcforward and calcbackward
'will. Placechar will need to be changed also. What the hell I did it today
'The engine is working fine all I need to do is write the code that will
'make it not be able to pass through walls.  I'm actually proud of all I
'have accomplished today.
'I have changed the variable from 4.52 to con which equals the same thing.
'I have established borders for the character.
'I developed a method to stop the arrow from passing through walls now
'all thats left is to develop the 3D rendering.
'Well all done.  The 3D rendering works fine, it's extremely buggy though.
'I'm not going to do anymore with this program, I've done enough.
'It takes so much memory qbasic 4.5 can't convert it to an .exe I'm
'kind of disapointed.  No matter it will be fine.
'I made view1 look a lot better creating 0.02b.

'DEGIF6.BAS - No frills GIF decoder for the VGA's 320x200x256 mode.
'By Rich Geldreich 1993 (Public domain, use as you wish.)
'This version should properly decode all LZW encoded images in
'GIF image files. I've finally added GIF89a and local colormap
'support, so it more closely follows the GIF specification. It
'still doesn't support the entire GIF89a specification, but it'll
'show most GIF files fine.
'The GIF decoding speed of this program isn't great, but I'd say
'for an all QB/PDS decoder it's not bad!
