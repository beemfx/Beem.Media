This is the art for explor.

Tiles are organized into sets.  A set is one 280x160 bitmap.  The
first tile in the set should occupy a 160x160 space starting at 0,0.
The second tile should occupy a 40x160 space starting at 200, 0.
The third tile should occupy a 40x160 space staring at 240, 0.

I currently have two available sets.

set0001.bmp - Default walls
set0002.bmp - default doors
