Version 3.xxB

System Requirments:
Windows ME/98/2000/XP (May work on NT and 95); 
DirectX 8.0 or higher; DirectX compatible sound card; 
DirectX compatible video card.

I'm not sure about any other requirements, but here's a guess.
32 MB RAM; 200 MHz Intel or AMD processor (or compatible).

To play run the EXE file.  Use the arrow keys to move around.  At this point in 
development there is nothing to do except move around, no monsters or anything. 
I doubt I'll ever finish this game.  I wrote it more or less as practice.  
ScrollGIN technology will be a lot better anyhow.
