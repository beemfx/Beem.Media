lm_sys: Legacy Mesh/Skeleton Formats
Copyright (C) 2007 Blaine Myers

Formats:

LMESH (Legacy Mesh):
EXT: .lmsh

LSKEL (Legacy Skeleton):
EXT: .lskl



This folder contains the source code for the Legacy 3D model format as well
as all exporters that have been created for the said model format.  The
files and their purposes are:

lm_sys.cpp: The source code for loading and saving LMeshs (CLMesh).
   Header: lm_sys.h

lm_skel.cpp: The source code for loading and saving LSkels (CLSkel, CLFrame), 
   also contains code for gnerating joint transforms.
   Header: lm_sys.h

lm_d3d.cpp: Contains child classes of CLMesh and CLSkel that are capable of
   rendering the said objects using Direct3D9 interfaces (CLMeshD3D, 
   CLSkelD3D).
   Header: lm_d3d.h

lm_edit.cpp: Contaitns child classes of CLMeshD3D and CLSkelD3D that have
   methods used to manipulate CLSkels and CLMeshs.
   Header: lm_edit.h

lm_ms.cpp: Contains child classes of CLMesh and CLSkel that are used to load
   the said objects for exporting with Milkshape3D.
   Header: lm_ms.h


PROJECTS THAT USE THESE FILES:

msLMEXP.dll (Milkshape 3D Legacy Engine Format Exporter):
   Uses: lm_sys.cpp, lm_skel.cpp, lm_ms.cpp
   Purpose: Exports Legacy Engine Mesh and Skeleton format files.

Legacy.exe (Legacy Game Engine):
   Uses: lm_sys.cpp, lm_skel.cpp, lm_d3d.cpp
   Purpose: Legacy Game Engine.

LMEdit.exe (Legacy Mesh (& Skeleton) Editor):
   Uses: lm_sys.cpp, lm_skel.cpp, lm_edit.cpp
