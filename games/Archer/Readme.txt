Instructions:
	At the very beginning of the game you will be prompted as to the speed you wish to execute the program.  1 Will run fine on a 75Mhz computer about 20 for a 450Mhz computer. You'll have to guestimate for any other processor speeds.

	After that you will need to choose your difficulty level.  Just type the letter of your choice.

	After selecting your difficulty level you will go to the view.  You'll see your weapon at the base of the screen, and a man moving across the screen.  Press space to fire as so as he is in the center of the screen to hit him.  If you miss you will die and be prompted to begin again.  If you hit him he will die and the game will end.
