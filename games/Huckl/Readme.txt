This folder inlcudes:
	Huckl.exe - The Huckleberry executable.
	Readme.txt - This File.

Instructions:
	At the main menu you can press the number 
	corresponding to your choice.  While playing the 
	raft will sail down the river.  Read the text and 
	choose the best answer.  You will have had to read 
	the book 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' to 
	complete the game.  If you guess wrong Huck will 
	get an unrewarding surprise but you will be allowed 
	to continue.

Note:
	This game was developed as a project for my Junior 
	Year English Class during the Huckleberry Finn unit.
