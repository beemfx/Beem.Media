WExplorED is a win32 based application for developing maps for the Explor Engine.

Notice: There are also many obsolete tools in the obsolete directory.  None of which have any importance.

I will not document the use of this application, because I may never work on explor again.  The only way I will work on explor is if I learn Direct3D well enough to utilize it in the application, but I won't document this application anyway.

This application was never really completed, it is impossible to change a property value, not that it matters because the game doesn't use property values.  On an interesting note, there is not way to start a new map with this application.  In fact the only way to create your own map is to either edit a file manually (impossible if you don't know the map format) or to load an existing map and modify it.

The only exciting thing about this application is going through the screenshots because it shows how the application has evolved, from DOS to Windows.
