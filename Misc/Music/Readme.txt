Music
	converted to Qbasic by B.M. Software

This folder includes:
	Canon.bas - The source code for canon
	Canon.exe - The executable for Canon
	Raiders.bas - The source code for raiders
	Raiders.exe - The executeable for raiders
	Readme.txt - This file

Note:
	It's just two music files:
		Canon in D Major - Johann Pachabell
		Indianna Jones Theme - John Williams

	Canon sounds really bad.  The Indianna Jones Theme sounds pretty good.
