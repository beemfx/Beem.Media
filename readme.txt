Beem Media Archive Depot
========================
This depot contains an archive of the software developed by Beem Media that are
no longer in active development. Most of the code was engineered by Blaine
Myers. Open source active projects are in other repositories, and closed source
projects are on private servers.

Most of this software is not particular useful (or even good) at this point and
is obsolete or is superceded by active projects.

The most interesting parts, in my opinion, are the QBasic games in the games
directory.
