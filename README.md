Open source projects by Beem Media (generally not in active development).
=======
QBasic-Games
============
Beem Software's early QBasic code including games! Beem's first game every was
also a QBasic game but it isn't featured in this repository. The game was called
Castle, and it evolved to a Windows game, so it has it's own repository at

https://github.com/beemfx/Castle

Bomb (Bomb)
===========
Beem's first game that featured graphics. A first person shooter.

Archer (Archer)
===============
Beem's second first person shooter. Sort of a sequel to Bomb except this time
you actually had to aim at the enemy, and you could be killed.

Joe's Copter (Joes)
===================
Beem's first side scroller game. This was to be followed up by Joe's Copter 2
which was never completed.

Night Killers 2 (Night2)
========================
After StarCraft came out I was excited for StarCraft 2, so I made an intro video
to SCII. Then thinking that that might be a copyright violation I changed the
title of my video to Night Killers 2. Making a video in code isn't easy.

Huckleberry's Adventure (Huckl)
===============================
In the 10th grade I had to do a project on the Twain's The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn. It was a personal choice project. Knowing a thing or two about
programming, I decided to make a video game. This is that game. One of my
friends mentioned to me that the teacher had said that the game didn't really
meet the requirements of the project, but because it was a video game it was so
freaking cool that I got an A anyway.

Dice Exposition (Dicexpo)
=========================
A dice based gambling game. Never completed.

Misc Code (Misc)
================
Various QBasic code I've written. No games.
