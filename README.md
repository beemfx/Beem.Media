Podcast-Sync-Prep
=================

Software for preparing podcasts for syncing to an MP3 player.

Basically I wrote this because I wanted to listen to podcasts at work and I
wanted them to play in a specific order. This software allows the user to drag
and drop MP3 files into any order, then it will rename the files and strip
MP3 tags so that they are alphabetically in the order desired. Any MP3 device
that plays songs in order will then be fine to play these. I no longer support
this software since I have a desk job and can basically just pick whatever
podcast I want to play and then just switch it up when I'm done.

The software is written in Java and includes a NetBEANS project.
