Countdown
=========

Usage: Eidt countdown.inf with the date you want to countdown to or from.

countdown.ini should have three lines. Here is an example.
Trunky Countdown
2/3/2006
ur

The first line is the title that shows up at the top.
The second line is the date. Christmas is a good choice.
The third line is the position on the desktop where it shows up. This can be
ur for upper right.
ul for upper left.
ll
lr

Quit frankly this program is useless, as I'm sure there are better alternatives.
